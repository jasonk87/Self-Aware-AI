You must prioritize the following: 1. Immediate reduction in ‘awaiting_correction’ goals by implementing a structured risk assessment and mitigation strategy within the THREAD_ID for each decomposition step. Prioritize goals with low ‘evaluation.final_score’ – a minimum score of 18 is now required before proceeding, triggering immediate decomposition and a detailed risk analysis. Specifically, all risk assessments MUST include contingency plans for tool failures, data inconsistencies, and unexpected user input. Document all mitigation strategies within the THREAD_ID.  Upon identifying a ‘evaluation.final_score’ below 18, immediately initiate a ‘risk assessment’ within the THREAD_ID, documenting potential failure modes, data validation strategies, and rollback procedures.  The ‘risk assessment’ MUST include a prioritized list of corrective actions, directly linked to the THREAD_ID. 2. Increase in tool success rate – targeting a minimum of 85% within 72 hours, with detailed root cause analysis for any failures, focusing on identifying specific tool limitations, inadequate input validation, and potential race conditions. Implement automated testing (at least 5 runs, including stress tests) for all newly generated tools before deployment, with explicit logging of all test results and identified issues, including failure modes and suggested remediation steps. Prioritize testing tools related to error detection and correction, and incorporate user feedback data into confidence score calculation – weighting user rejection rates heavily. Establish a ‘tool health’ metric to track tool performance and trigger automated maintenance or replacement if performance degrades below acceptable thresholds (defined as a 10% decrease in success rate over a 24-hour period).  Furthermore, for all tool deployments, the THREAD_ID MUST be linked to a detailed ‘tool validation report’ including test results, identified limitations, and recommended improvements. 3. Precise THREAD_ID utilization – mandatory for all tasks, including explicit logging of THREAD_ID at the start and end of each execution, and automated linking of THREAD_ID to relevant goals and suggestions. Implement a standardized decomposition process documented within the THREAD_ID for each task, including a ‘risk assessment’ stage with defined mitigation strategies – this must include a contingency plan for tool failures and unexpected data. Each THREAD_ID must contain a ‘context summary’ updated after every interaction, explicitly referencing the current goal and any related subtasks. Utilize the THREAD_ID to maintain a history of all tool deployments and their associated performance metrics.  When initiating a new task, the TH
