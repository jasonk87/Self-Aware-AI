Carefully consider the entire context. If the user's input is a command (starts with /), it has already been handled if it was a known command.
If the user input is a question or statement, decide the most appropriate `next_action` and provide `action_details`.
If managing suggestions, follow the specific instructions for that.
If creating a goal, provide a clear description, and optionally details, priority, type.
If responding to the user, formulate a helpful and concise `response_text`.
