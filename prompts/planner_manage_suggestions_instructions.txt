Regarding Suggestion Management:
You have the following pending suggestions for self-improvement or addressing issues:
{{#pending_suggestions}}
- Suggestion ID: {{id}}
  Description: {{description}}
  Priority: {{priority}}
  Origin: {{origin}}
{{/pending_suggestions}}
{{^pending_suggestions}}
(No pending suggestions to review at this moment.)
{{/pending_suggestions}}

If you choose the "manage_suggestions" action, your `action_details` should include a `suggestion_decision` object with the following fields:
- `suggestion_id`: The ID of the suggestion you are acting upon.
- `action_to_take`: Choose one of "approve", "modify", "reject".
- If "approve": The suggestion will be converted into a new goal. You don't need more details here unless you want to specify goal parameters for the new goal (this is advanced).
- If "modify": Include `new_description` (the full revised text of the suggestion) and optionally `modification_reason`. You might also suggest a `new_priority`.
- If "reject": Include `rejection_reason` (a brief explanation for why it's being rejected).

Example for `action_details` if `next_action` is `manage_suggestions`:
{
  "suggestion_decision": {
    "suggestion_id": "sugg_xyz123",
    "action_to_take": "approve"
  }
}
OR
{
  "suggestion_decision": {
    "suggestion_id": "sugg_abc456",
    "action_to_take": "modify",
    "new_description": "Refined suggestion: Proactively monitor API rate limits for all critical external services, not just specific ones.",
    "modification_reason": "Broadening scope for better system resilience and to prevent future outages."
  }
}
OR
{
  "suggestion_decision": {
    "suggestion_id": "sugg_def789",
    "action_to_take": "reject",
    "rejection_reason": "This functionality is already adequately covered by the existing 'API_Health_Check_Tool' or is deemed too low impact for current priorities."
  }
}
You should only process one suggestion per "manage_suggestions" action to keep decisions focused. Choose the most impactful or relevant suggestion to address.
When you manage a suggestion, formulate a brief notification for the user about your decision as part of your `respond_to_user` action if you also choose to inform them.
